/*
	An NSView that displays a file path. This looks kind of like how Sherlock
	displays the location of a file. Basically you get each folder's display
	name with its icon in front of it, and little grey triangles between
	them, and you get the icon of the file or folder at the end and its display
    name.
	
	If the path is too long, this takes items out of the middle and displays
	an ellipsis character (...) instead.
	
	You can also right-click or control-click on this to get a contextual menu
	that contains "Reveal in Finder" and "Show Real Names" menu choices. Real
	names displays the actual path, starting with "/", and using the actual
	file names instead of their display names. As a shortcut, double-clicking
	this view is the same as "Reveal in Finder".
	
	This needs:
		- PathArrow.tiff (for the little triangle)
		- UKGraphics.h/.m (for drawing the bezel around the view)
