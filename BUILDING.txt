To build MAS, do the following:

1) Open Application/MAS.xcodeproj and build.

2) Copy the resulting MAS.app file into your /Applications folder.

3) Make sure you've downloaded the packages for the ExternalDependencies/Archives/ folder (see ExternalDependencies/Archives/DIRECTIONS.txt)

4) Run the ./buildmas.sh shell script

You can now run the copy of MAS in your /Applications folder.

Have fun, and please contribute what you can!
